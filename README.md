# Learning.js

ENG: Learning.js is a repository made for storing all of my solved exercises, since from udemy courses, to my school's programming classes, and it will be for storing future projects too.
It will contain projects from various languages, such as HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express & Mongo. maybe I'll store Swift/Kotlin projects from cotemig classes.
Keeping in mind that this repository will not have my practice projects or serious projects, like python shutdown, they will have their own repository.
